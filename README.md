# Travel Pal

Travel Pal is a trip planning web application that includes a packing list, itinerary, budget tracker, and
calendar feature. This application is built using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, JQuery,
and public web APIs. The purpose of this web application is to help people plan and organize their travels
better, sorting travel aspects out into different pages and making them accessible and customizable
wherever they go.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Page Development: 
Overall resources: 
https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/ and all documentation for React Bootstrap Components

### Home
The home page allows users to input any basic information about their trip - the dates they'll be traveling, where they are going, and any additional notes to themselves while preparing. The local storage on this page also allows users to have their trip information saved upon entry (until they clear it). 

Resources used: 
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49007357/how-to-make-the-whole-card-component-clickable-in-material-ui-using-react-js (for linking the cards)
- https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ficons8.com%2Fillustrations%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0ZrgvDANBVFglIEDvqO9fDxGykwbsBk8084Z6jj4JjvhlRkcwwSctE7kw&h=AT0RInnaaQys0_lUEr0LGazvrq6-BL8v9VoXjRxahKUv-3sQenZxCRWg2MVeuuF03-Q5smD_TTK68L62Is-IDlgKsPKYjaJxsR4gipMaZBjFYjHVHP3IFrN10K7Oid4f1L9ElPv1TSQ (for our icons within the cards)
- Development and storage from the itinerary page (which was developed before this one)
### Packing List
The packing list page allows users to enter any items they made need on their trip, and keep track of those items as they pack them. The percentage bar on the page allows them to see how much they have packed and they need to pack, and when they are done they can remove their completed packed items. 

Resources used: 
- https://github.com/prabhath6/to-do-list-react-bootstrap/tree/master/src (helped with foundation of Packing List [explained more in PackingList.js])
- The formatting of other pages (Budget Tracker, etc.) to help centralize and format this page

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
